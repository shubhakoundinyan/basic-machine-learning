OVERVIEW:

Feature Selection is a process where one can automatically select the specific features in the selected dataset that contribute significantly to the prediction variable or the desired outcome.

Feature Selection is a step before DATA MODELING. It improves the accuracy of the data thereby helping better decision making and it reduces the training time which means the algorithms (linear, logistic regression) train faster.

WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO:

This script would perform data analysis on the data that has been supplied as the source. JMI (Joint Mutual Information) is employed to implement the feature selection. It uses the Regression Algorithm (Machine Learning) to train a model, and that model is tested on the dataset. The dataset used is here the Iris Dataset available on the UCI Repository.
